Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#35 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.162 ns between k_reg[4]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and music2sound_0/c0_reg_reg[12]_C/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

There is a large setup violation of -2.167 ns between k_reg[4]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and music2sound_0/c0_reg_reg[12]_P/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
